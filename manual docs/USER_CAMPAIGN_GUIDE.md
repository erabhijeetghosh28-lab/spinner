## 💸 5. Maximizing Profit: The Secret Sauce

Turn fun spins into serious revenue.

1.  **The "Loss Leader" Strategy:**
    *   Give away something small (free appetizer, free shipping) to get them in the door.
    *   *Result:* Most customers will buy a main course or a full-priced item once they are there.

2.  **The "Upsell" Coupon:**
    *   Instead of "Free Product", offer "₹500 Off on orders above ₹2000".
    *   *Result:* You increase your Average Order Value (AOV). The customer spends *more* to use the coupon.

3.  **Remarketing Goldmine:**
    *   You now have their phone number. Don't let it sit there!
    *   *Action:* Send a WhatsApp blast on Friday: "Hey! You still haven't used your 10% off spin prize. Expires tonight!"

4.  **Create Urgency:**
    *   Add a "Spin expires in 24 hours" note in your campaign description.
    *   *Result:* Drives immediate action instead of "I'll do it later."
