## Follow-Up Prompts

**After first generation:**

```
This looks great! Can you create 2 variations of this design:
1. A darker version with more contrast
2. A more playful version with illustrations

Keep the same layout structure but adjust colors and visual style.
```

**To refine specific sections:**

```
I love the overall design. Can you create 3 alternative versions of just the hero section? Focus on:
- Different spin wheel placements (left, center, right)
- Various headline layouts
- Different CTA button styles

Keep the orange and navy color scheme.
```
