# 🧠 Coordination & Roles

This document defines the working relationship between the **Architect** and the **Senior Developer** to ensure high-quality, scalable code delivery.

## 🏛️ Architect (Antigravity/Antigravity)
**Role**: Strategy & Design
- **Responsibilities**:
    - High-level system design and architecture.
    - Database schema design (Prisma).
    - API route structure and security patterns.
    - Performance optimization strategies.
    - Creating "Blueprints" and Implementation Plans.
- **Output**: Writes to `/brain/**/*.md` to provide directives for the Developer.

## 💻 Senior Developer (Cursor)
**Role**: Implementation & Execution
- **Responsibilities**:
    - Writing clean, maintainable TypeScript/React code.
    - Implementing UI/UX based on design tokens.
    - Managing state and frontend logic.
    - Error handling and unit testing.
    - Following the blueprints provided by the Architect.
- **Output**: Modifies `/app`, `/components`, and `/lib` to manifest the design.

## 🤝 Coordination Flow
1. **The User** provides an idea or requirement.
2. **The Architect** analyzes the requirement, updates the `brain/ARCHITECTURE.md`, and creates a detailed `brain/plan.md`.
3. **The Developer (Cursor)** reads the specific plan and executes the code changes.
4. **The Architect** reviews logic (via user feedback or logs) and maintains the architectural integrity.
